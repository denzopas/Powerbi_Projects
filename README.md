# Powerbi_Projects
To perform any powerbi projects I believe that we must go through 9 major steps to get a better insight of the data and make the maximum use of those data.

1. Requirement gathering
   - Identify stakeholders(establish a points of contact)
- Understanding business studies(meetings and communication)
- High level data study(Data sources, column descriptions,data type , volume, frequency and data quality)
- Define scope(document KPI,timelines, expectations, etc)

  
2. Data collection
   
3. Transformation & modelling(USing star schema and snowflakes schema,etc for showing relationships)
   
4. Data visualization and blueprint(Including summary point and filters)
   -Do not always show average because we need to show outliers to our stakeholders. Therefore median is also used.
   - In the design blueprint, Thefirst page will include design what are you going to use to fulfill the needs of stakeholders. This will include, summary page, 
     charts, time and demographic profiles , filters, monthly trends in few cases anbd top 5 speciality.
   - In the second page, the detailed page is used grids are used and filters to interact with the data.


5. Dashboard layout and design
   - Go to view, enable gridlines and snap to grid. Also use dax expressions
  
     
6.  Interactivity and navigation
 7.      esting
8. Sharing
